The ambulances respond to calls weekly and during our busy times daily and as often as 3 times within a 24 hour  period.  A majority of the volunteers have full time day jobs and often respond to 1 or 2 calls during the night and report back to work in the morning.  It takes a very dedicated community member to give this much time! They do this week after week to ensure someone is available to serve you in your time of need.
