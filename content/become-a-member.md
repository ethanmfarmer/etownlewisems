Etown-Lewis EMS is always looking for interested, energetic, dedicated folks who want to help people and make a difference in the community. Below are some of the more common questions we are often asked about volunteering with our agency, but it is by no means every answer to every question. If you have more questions or concerns about volunteering, please don't hesitate to call our station: (518) 873-2122 or email us at [etownlewisems@gmail.com](mailto:etownlewisems@gmail.com).
